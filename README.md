# freeCodeCamp_notes
My notes and course reviews for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## 📌 Purpose
This is an active tool for reflection, retention, and roadmap building. I document what I’ve learned, identify gaps in my understanding, and offer insights for fellow learners, educators, and platform designers.

## 📁 Structure
- **Module reviews:** Short reflections and clarifications after each section.
- **Code samples:** Safe-to-share projects and key snippets.
- **Summaries:** One-line explanations that reinforce recall and cumulative understanding.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy
I use a summarisation method focused on active recall:
1. Summarise each paragraph in a single line.
2. Add a one-line progress note at every step.
3. Repeat consistently to build a trail of micro-understandings.
This method might seem verbose at first, but it boosts retention and saves review time later.

## 🧵 Why Do This Publicly?
- **For me:** Writing solidifies learning.
- **For you:** This repo can serve as a preview of the course or an example of spaced, reflective learning in action.
